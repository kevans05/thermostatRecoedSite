                one device and another measurement made in as similar a way as possible with a second device.</i></p>

             <p><i>The device with the known or assigned correctness is called the standard. The second device is the unit
                 under test, test instrument, or any of several other names for the device being calibrated(Wikipidia 2014). </i></p>
